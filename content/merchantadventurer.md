## The Genesis of the Idea

In the same way that How to Succeed in Evil riffs on the superhero genre, the merchant adventurer riffs on fantasy. While working on [Wasteland 2](http://www.patrickemclean.com/2012/wasteland2) I did a lot of thinking about storytelling in cRPGs. I was somewhat surprised to find that I had a deep knowledge about the genre. From Wizardry, Nethack, Ultima, Elder Scrolls, I've played them all. And, in my youth, I closed out the fantasy genre in both my local bookstore and library. 

As I was writing dialog for many of the NPCs in WL2, I had this thought: What must a cRPG look like from the point of view of the guy who runs the shop?

For me, the archetypal shopkeeper is Boltac, the merchant in the first Wizardry. Boltac's was the only place you could buy, sell or get things identified. He had no personality in the game, but he was absolutely ruthless with his pricing. Perfect arbitrage meant that you got no value from looting the dungeon. He charged exactly what something was worth to identify it! You couldn't win with this guy. 

So from Boltac's perspective, all these half-assed adventurers come through, try to nickel and dime him, and then go off to defeat the Evil Wizard. And none of them succeed. And most of them get killed. In short, the Heroes are incompetent. Yeah, yeah, kid, here's your sword. Good luck, whattya want on your tombstone. 

So my question became, under what circumstances does the Merchant take matters into his own hands and save the day? How do you get that character off the sidelines and into the action? And further, how could the Merchant actually win? 

## Excerpt from Chapter 2 

*Rattick, a thief, [^1] has guided a party of naive adventurers to their death so he could steal their equipment. In this excerpt he has come to Boltac to pawn his ill-gotten goods.*



RATTICK THREW THE NECKLACE on the oak counter and watched the light dance in it like a living thing. He nodded at it and asked, "Have you ever seen such exquisite workmanship?"

Boltac, the merchant on the other side of the counter, picked up the Ruby Necklace and examined it closely. He gave Rattick a hard look. Boltac's eyes were sharp points swathed in a soft round face. As he edged into middle age, it seemed that only his strong jaw saved his countenance from sloughing down his neck into flabbiness.

After careful consideration, Boltac licked his thumb, rubbed the necklace's setting and muttering, "you missed a spot."

"Missed a spot?" asked Rattick, as smooth as water over river rock. 

"Blood, Rattick. There's some blood left on this necklace."

Rattick shrugged. "Probably mine. I try to use stealth, but the Orc I took it from put up quite a fight."

"En-henh," Boltac said as ran his hand across his shaven pate, "Not that I want to know, but what is an Orc?"

"A fearsome new creature wreaking havoc on the good people of Robrecht."

"En-henh," said Boltac, not buying it, "And, you uh, count yourself among those good people?" 

"Of course. I am no mighty hero, like some, but I do the small part that I can."

"Okay, Rattick, I'm gonna make you an offer on your necklace here. The setting is crap, but the stone is very nice. But before I do, not for nuttin' but Orcs? You're shittin' me right?"

"Oh no, stout merchant, I assure you, Orcs are very real."

"Really? Kobolds, I heard of. Trolls, I heard of. Dragons, sure, but Orcs? C'mon. What does an Orc look like?"

"Gentle Merchant, I hope that you never see one, but I assure you, if you do, you will know for the Orc that it is."

"En-henh,"

"Let me tell you the fearsome tale of how I came to acquire this necklace and then perhaps you will better understand the threat that the fearsome Orc--"

"You can spare me the story, Rattick," said Boltac.

"You don't enjoy tales of valor?" asked Rattick with a smile.

"Tales of Valor? No. I enjoy tales of profit."

"I don't know any sagas that involve tales of profit," said Rattick, "But tales of valor, of great daring... The bards sing many songs of those."

"Yeah, I don't really care for singing either. In fact, let's just cut all the bullshit. I'm pretty sure I know how you got this."

"Yessssss," purred Rattick, running his finger over the Ruby, "but do you care?"

"Not if you'll take 15 gold for it I don't."

"15 gold? I risked my neck for this!""

"You? I'm pretty sure *you* risked somebody else's neck for this particular bauble. Fine, 17 for the gem, and 2 gold for the rest of it." Boltac said, indicating the pile of equipment on the floor. 

"But this sword almost defeated a troll!"

"Yeah, and it almost doesn't have that huge nick in it. And why does everything in that pile smell like Troll shit?"

They haggled like this for a while, and settled on a price 22 gold for the lot. When Rattick left, Boltac muttered a curse and had to work to keep from spitting on his own floor.
