# 'Evil Extras

Below is an excerpt of a sequence that I took out of the first How to Succeed in Evil. Topper decided that he wanted to be a detective and ran away with the story. (He's good like that.) And even though it didn't fit in the flow of the narrative, it's still a fun, absurd and pointlessly violent romp. So, if you like Topper, you'll like it. 

Also, if you haven't seen it, [here is a link](http://www.succeedinevil.com/evilfinalsmall.pdf) to an early promotional comic I produced with artist [Nic Rummel](http://nicrummel.deviantart.com/gallery/) In many ways, the story and the characters have evolved beyond this early experiment, but I still love Nic's art.

## Topper Haggleblat, Ace Detective.


It goes without saying that Topper was in love with himself. He also hated himself, but isn’t that always the way? Life and lives are complex.  But at this point in the story, the self-love is the important part to understand. You see Topper was pretty sure he wasn’t a Good Guy™, but he loved himself so much, that he couldn’t bear to think of himself as anything other than the protagonist of any story that he found himself in. And, whether he would admit it or not, he imagined that this part of the story was entitled, Topper Haggleblat, Ace Detective. And even he would have appreciated the fact that it was a short story.

As Topper hit the bricks outside Edwin’s office, he was already thinking of the matter as a missing person case. Sure, it had a twist. The guy he was looking for knocked over buildings. That meant that the case had a lot of angles. All of them bent or broken. It also meant that Barry was easy to track. Not that anybody could be hard to track for a Shamus like Topper. He stopped in at the corner store, bought a pint of whiskey, was disappointed to find they didn’t sell fedoras and, then headed to the scene of the crime.

The crime scene had grown substantially since Topper had last been there. Topper’s keen powers of observation led him to notice a block-wide swath of destruction leading southwest. He took a pull off the bottle and continued his sleuthing in that direction.  His instincts assured him that he would find Barry at the end of the trail. That, and the fact that he could still hear explosions in the distance. As he scrambled over the wreckage, he cursed his short legs.  He climbed on top of an overturned desk and took another pull from the bottle. In the distance a building shuddered and fell. Ahah! The game was afoot.

As he continuing to struggle through the ruins, Topper longed for a cab. Why was there never a friggin’ cab when you needed one.  Maybe he should have hired litter bearers? There were wheelchair detectives right? Why not a detective that was carried around by his beautiful, highly trained female clue ninjas? But they would need a name. A better name than clue ninjas. The bloodhounds? No, no. It wasn’t sexy enough. The Babehounds? Yes, Babehounds. That would do.

He closed his eyes and imagined skimpy outfits on ridiculously top-heavy women. His creative reverie was interrupted by the sound of helicopters. He opened his eyes and saw helicopters were flying away from the scene. What had happened? Had they managed to kill the strong man? That would be bad news. Then Topper heard a terrific boom from above. He looked up and saw him. Hero of heroes. Friend to the beset. The pride of America. There was Excelsior flying low over the rubble.

“Faggotty spandex’d American Flagity Bastard”, Topper yelled at the the hero. But Excelsior did not hear him. “It’s not fair. Edwin gets a good client and then he has to go and get himself caught!”

“ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!” Barry’s inarticulate battle cry rang through the deserted city. As the echo died down Topper saw a police car, sirens blaring, lights flashing, fly through the air and slam into the side of a concrete building. As the car tumbled down the face of the building, the sound of the initial impact reached Topper on a delay. As it crashed to Earth the sirens made a last sad warble and were silent.

Topper headed back to the streets. He had decided that he would make better time skirting the edge of the destruction, rather than trying to crawl and claw his way through it. He scanned the streets for a taxi, but they were deserted. Everyone had fled. And here came the police, leaving the area at top speed, leaving the problem to Excelsior.

Topper expected them to stop and tell him to flee. Or ask him what he was doing there. Or do any one of the thousand obnoxious things that police did. But they ignored him. And worse than anything, Topper hated being ignored. He walked out into the middle of the street and yelled at the disappearing tail lights, “Cowards!”

At this point, a more sensible man would have turned back. For what can mere mortals do when Gods do battle? But Topper pressed on. He had no idea how he might subdue and recapture Barry. To say nothing of freeing him from what had to be the most powerful hero of the day. Topper wasn’t a planner. He subscribed to what he called the parachute theory — why waste time learning how to parachute? If you needed the skill, you have plenty of time to figure it out on the way down.

As Topper rounded the last corner, he saw the mighty Excelsior make a low strafing run with his heat vision. The ground melted and turned to glass. At the end of the run was Barry. Barry didn’t look all that threatening. Big, yes, but he mostly looked tired, and lost. Somehow dissipated and harmless. When the fiery beam crackled across Barry’s skin and he didn’t seem to care.

This got Topper’s blood up. Sure, sometimes a guy’s gotta take a beating. But you never take it without a fight. “C’mon!” he shrieked, “put up a--”

Presumably, Topper was going to end that sentence with the word “fight”, but the world will never know for sure. Because as Excelsior floated past Barry’s head, Barry lept up and grabbed his costumed foot. It was completely nonchalant. As if he had suddenly realized there was a high fly ball coming right for him.

Before Excelsior could fly off, or even fully register what had happened, Barry slung the hero over his head and slammed him into the ground. The hero hit so hard the Topper felt the ground shift beneath his feet. Before the dust from the first impact could even settle, Barry lofted Excelsior over his head again and slammed him into the ground on the other side. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Back and forth, back and forth, until the remnants of a nearby building finally just gave up and collapsed completely. Barry turned his head to see where the noise came from. He tossed the battered Excelsior over his shoulder like a toy he was no longer interested in playing with.

“YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! HELLS YEAH!” screamed Topper, jumping up and down uncontrollably. He scrambled through the debris and ran to Barry’s side like a hyperactive Spaniel. He tugged on what was left of Barry’s pant leg. “Hey, Barry. It’s me, you’re old buddy Topper!”

Barry turned and grunted. And, for a minute, it seemed like everything would work out fine. Then Barry’s eyelids dropped and his nostrils flared. Topper got the barest glimpse of red hot anger in the hooded slits. The he saw the sky, the ground, the sky, the ground, the sky, the ground and blackness.

Barry slapped Topper so hard he flew three whole blocks before he bounced and started to roll.



Most of the time, when a person wakes up after being knocked unconscious, there is a period of confusion. Questions like, “How did I get here?”, “Where did this headache come from?” and “Why is the taste of licorice in my mouth?” create a traffic jam in the frontal lobe through which current events cannot pass. All the alarm bells are ringing, but no one shows up with the answers.

This was not the case with Topper. When he opened his eyes, he avoided the “How did I get here?” question because he knew right where he was. And he knew just what he was going to do. He smiled and let one word slip passed his cracked teeth. “Babehounds!” Then he picked himself up off the sidewalk and staggered up the steps of an unusually ancient and out of place, three story Victorian townhome. He didn’t bother to knock. He just pushed the door open with his face and fell inside. Still smiling.


Excelsior was a different story. He lay on the ground, motionless, in the center of a pulverized concrete outline of his body. Because Excelsior had quite a bit of pride, it would be hard to get him to admit that he was ever knocked unconscious, so, to smooth things over, let’s just say that he wasn’t very interested in opening his eyes. That is, until someone started kicking him in the ribs.

Ordinarily, a weak kick would not have hurt Excelsior, but he had been through the beating of his life, and his ribs were more than a little tender. So Excelsior gasped in pain and opened his eyes.  The person kicking him jumped into focus. It was the ugliest man he had ever seen. Excelsior was sure of this, because he had seen him before.

“Jesus Gus, lay off.” But Gus did no such thing. He kept giving the fallen hero the slipper.

“C’mon lard-ass. No laying down on the job. You ah, ack, ack, ack.” Gus broke down into a mucus-soaked death rattle of a cough.

“Easy Gus, Easy”, said Excelsior, rising to a sitting position and immediately regretting it.

Gus hacked and spat. Even before the hunk of lung butter had a chance to hit the sidewalk, the old man had crammed another cigarette in the corner of his mouth. “C’mon pissant, you’re not going to spread the blinding light of American sunshine lying down there on your duff.”

“I don’t feel so good.”

Gus lit the cigarette. On the side of the lighter, the faded memory of an Airborne logo was almost visible. The smoke that Gus exhaled from that first drag was so strong it was more blue than white. “Yeah, yeah, yeah”, he continued, “Now you know what I feel like when I get out of bed. Candyass. So far you’re the only hero in the entire history of walking tall, kicking ass and shitting bullets hasn’t had to carry on after he’s had a beat down. Time to tough, tough, auHooooo hough hough hough.” Gus coughed his lungs down to a wheeze.

Excelsior got to his feet. Jesus this hurt. He had never hurt like this before. He felt a little nauseous. He didn’t like at all. He reached out to comfort Gus in his coughing fit. Gus slapped his hand away.

“toUGHEN YOU UP”, roared Gus with surprising force. “What? You turning fag on me now boy? Is that what you’re doing? Don’t you go all sensitive on me just because you got your ass kicked. That’s how it starts. Saw a whole platoon go fag during the Battle of the Bulge.”

“Up close and personal?”

“You keep joking flyboy, I know what means to take a beating and keep on going.”

“Yeah, you look it.”

“Aw you’re just jealous because I’m so goddamned pretty”, Gus’s parchment skin drew tight across the bones of his skull as his faceleather untwisted into a smile.

“Okay, okay. You win. You’re tough. The only guy who could kick your ass is John Wayne.”

“Bullshit. He was an actor. I’m the real thing.”

“So where is he?” Excelsior asked as three vertebrae in his back realigned with a distressingly loud pop.

“You mean the guy who cleaned your clock?”

“No, the ... I mean… yeah”, Excelsior said. It had finally sunk in that he had, for the first time, had his ass kicked.

“He’s over there a ways.”

“All right”, Excelsior said as he rolled his neck, “I’ll be right back.”

“No you don’t. We’ve got orders.”

“Orders?”

“We’re falling back. We going to regroup.”

“Fall BACK!” Excelsior immediately regretted yelling. He had just discovered that it hurt to yell with a broken rib. He had also learned that it hurt to breath, hurt to stand, hurt to twist -- in fact, he was beginning to get the idea that everything hurts when you have a broken rib. And yelling doubly so. Jesus, thought Excelsior, is this what the ordinary people felt like all the time?

“Protocol. We’ve got to come up with a game plan.”

“But he just got lucky.”

“No he didn’t.”

“You didn’t even see what happened”, Excelsior protested.

“Saw the whole thing on satellite. You got your tights-wearing ass handed to you.”

“I was careless.”

“Like that’s a surprise. Now listen to me son,” Excelsior hated it when Gus called him son. They were almost the same age. He figured Gus was just pissed that he hadn’t gotten physically older. But Gus was always pissed, so how could you tell? Excelsior wondered if the only thing holding the old man together was tumors and anger.

“Son,” Gus repeated himself to get Excelsior’s attention, “We ain’t ever seen anything you couldn’t beat without really trying. Now I know you’ll get him. I know you will. You’ll beat his ass until it glows like a ring-tailed baboon.”

“Yeah I will.”

“But right now, we’ve got orders to pull back. Re-group and come up with a game plan. We keep making this thing angry and it’s just going to destroy more of the city. Hurt more people. You don’t want that, do you?”

Excelsior sulked. “No”, he said, when what he really mean was, “I don’t care. I just want to get back into the fight.”

Gus was pleased to hear the frustrated rage in Excelsior’s voice. Of course they had realized this day would come. The day they no longer had the biggest kid on the block on their side. But you never know, really know, how a man will react to losing.

In Gus’ mind it was combat. The guy you thought was the toughest hombre for miles would sometimes go to pieces after the first artillery shell. While the little guy you figured was only good for making coffee would come walking back from the battle with a leg full of shrapnel and spear full of scalps. Sure, Excelsior had lost, but at least he hadn’t fallen to pieces.

“Then c’mon. Let’s go see what those egg heads in the lab coats have come up with.” They headed off. Gus tried not to cough. Excelsior tried not to limp. As he looked back on the field of his defeat, he saw something impossible. He shook his head. Could really be that he, the most powerful creature on Earth, had been knocked silly? Had to be. Because Excelsior had thought he saw a midget. And there couldn’t be a midget back there. Could there?


Yes there could. As Gus and Excelsior left the field of battle, a strange new procession was making it’s way on. Six beautiful women carried Topper on  a makeshift litter constructed from couch cushions, bedposts and heavy velvet drapes. None of these women knew obscure styles of Kung Fu. Nor were they expert marksmen, knife throwers or poisonous animal trainers. But for Topper, they were close enough.

They were extremely high priced call girls. And Topper knew most of them by name. He was several of their best customers. You see, Topper had awoken on the steps of his favorite brothel. And it sure wasn’t the first time it had happened. It wasn’t even the first time he had fallen in the front door.

As his little body hit the inside of the building, there was a flutter of concern and scented, lacy things as beautiful women flocked to his aid. The Evanston Street brothel had a long history of being a Civilized place. Not the kind of place where an injured man fell in the front door. And as Topper was bloodied, bruised and lightly concussed, he played it for all it was worth.

“I’ve always loved you best Rose”, said Topper melodramatically. There was no girl named Rose in the house, but in all the commotion nobody seemed to care or notice. Except Mina. She was different.

Mina was the lady of the house, so to speak. And when she saw Topper lying in her lavishly decorated foyer, bleeding lightly into an expensive Oriental rug, she had concerns other than his well-being. She just wanted this mess out of her fine establishment. But Topper had been a good customer. If he lived, he might continue to be a good customer, so she asked, “Do you require a doctor? Because if you do, we don’t sell those here.”

Topper perked right up. “Oh no, I’m fine. I just came here to pick up reinforcements.”

And so it was that Topper set out on safari with the six of the most beautiful and alluring courtesans that the city had ever known. Strength obviously wasn’t going to work on this beast. But every beast had a weakness for beauty. The question was, which beauty? And, of course, how to keep Barry from grabbing the girl in one hand, climbing a tall building with her and getting shot down by a swarm of WWI biplanes spewing bullets indiscriminately into a highly populated area?

But did Topper concern himself with these questions? Nah. He told himself if this went wrong again, he probably wouldn’t survive it. But he had enjoyed a two shots of bourbon, a world class blowjob and one of the finest painkillers that modern medicine could provide. It was as good a way to go as any.

“What are we looking for?” asked Tanja, the tawny haired Babehound in the lead. Topper explained that they were on a mission to seduce a very strong and dangerous man, “Not a sensitive, concerned softy like me you understand”, and that they should have all of their well-honed wiles at the ready. Some of the girls giggled politely. All of them thought he was an idiot.

“Are you sure this is safe? What happened out here?”

“Of course it’s safe, the tornado has passed”, said Topper.

“So who is this man?”

“Well, he’s more or less the tornado.”

“Is he cute?”

“BABEHOUNDS HO!” Topper cried, as he held up one hand like a Roman cavalry commander about to cross the Rhine. And he pointed across a parking lot.

On the far side, Barry was spinning the wheel of an overturned car and watching the funny shapes his face made in the gleaming hubcap.

“Him”, said Tanja, “He doesn’t look so bad.”

“Believe me sister, he punches his weight and then some.”
