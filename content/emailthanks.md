# Thanks for Joining

You have searched. You have sought. You have quite possibly autofilled the wrong form in a drunken stupor. But whatever the case may be, you are now part of an *Elite Few*. 

The Queen of England is not on this list. No past or current President is on this list. No Rock Star, Academy Award Winner or Bilderberg Attendee is on this list. But you? You, sir (or madame) have made the cut. Well, almost.

To complete the process of joining to what must be the most exclusive (or obscure) fraternity/sorority of which you've ever been a member, be sure to click in the link in the email that I just sent you. When you do you will gain access to bonus content from:

* How to Succeed in Evil
* The Merchant Adventurer
* Unkillable


So off you go, clickity-click. And thank you for your support and interest.
