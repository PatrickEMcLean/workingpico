# The Seanachai Podcast

In 2005 I set a goal. One essay or short story, written, recorded, edited, scored, etc., every week. I was a tremendous amount of work. But, I did it. 

It was very dark time in my life. I was frustrated, blocked and couldn't see a way through. Hope was in short supply. But I made The Seanachai anyway. And it changed my life. I learned, deep in my bones, the wisdom of these words of Ray Bradbury

> ACTION IS HOPE. At the end of each day, when you've done your work, you lie there and think. Well, I'll be damned. I did this today. It doesn't matter how good it is, or how bad -- you did it. At the end of the week you'll have a certain amount of accumulation. At the end of a year, you look back and say, I'll be damned. It's been a good year. 

Even though the Seanachai is parsed out in 5-7 minute increments, the entire podcast is more than 8 hours of accumulated audio. This tends to make it daunting for new listeners. So to enhance the accessibility, and more effectively suck people in, I've compiled a brief introduction.  It includes some of my favorite episodes (and some explanation of why) but it's by no means comprehensive.


So if I've left out a favorite, or you think something else should be included, please mention it in the comments.

## STORIES

* [The Vampire in My Attic](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/01/02/the-vampire-in-the-attic/) -- It's the first and still one of the best. Very short.
* [Candy](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/02/18/candy/) -- but then, there's Candy.
* [A Wolf in the Park](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/04/06/a-wolf-in-the-park/) -- A good tale and some of the best sound design and music.

## ESSAYS

* [Blame Abraham](http://www.theseanachai.com/2006/08/02/blame-abraham/) -- because there's only so much insanity you can watch without trying to understand it.
* [A Change in Orbit](http://www.theseanachai.com/2006/05/09/a-change-in-orbit/) -- I cried when I wrote it. I cried when I read it. It's good.
* [The Han Solo Theory](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/06/17/the-han-solo-theory/) -- a big light bulb went on when I figured this out.
* [St. Patrick's Day ](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/03/18/happy-st-patricks-day/)

## SERIES

_In many ways, I feel like I failed the original purpose of the Seanachai by doing series. It was originally supposed to be all short stories. But, as it turns out, short stories are murderously hard. Which is okay, these turned out to be really good.

* [The War with Santa](http://www.theseanachai.com/category/podcast/the-war-with-santa/) -- I still laugh when I listen to this, and I made it!
* [Death of a Dishwasher ](http://www.theseanachai.com/category/podcast/death-of-a-dishwasher/)-- Won a Parsec. Pure Restaurant Worker Catharsis.
* [How to Succeed in Evil](http://succeedinevil.com/category/podcast/page/3/) -- It has to be on the list, even though it's got it's [own website](http://www.succeedinevil.com) now. Start at the beginning.

## SATIRE

* [Outsourcing A Chicken](http://www.theseanachai.com/2006/04/22/outsourcing-a-chicken/) -- Because you just can't have too many reasons to dislike chain restaurants.
* [The Redneck Expeditionary Force](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/10/05/ref/) -- People seriously thought they could find this game online. I wish.

## JUST NUTS

_Sometimes, you just gotta blow the bugs out of the engine. _

* [A Scary Story](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/08/07/a-scary-story/) -- The best cautionary tale told by a "sailor" since the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors](http://www.theseanachai.com/2006/09/08/rock-paper-scissors/) -- This one also cracks me up every time I listen to it. Best voicing I've done.
* [Truth is](http://www.theseanachai.com/2005/06/26/truth-is/) -- who doesn't like a good Zombie love story.
