Title: Unkillable Extras

*/



IT PAINS ME TO ADMIT THIS, but Unkillable is 1/3rd of an unfinished work. I wrote a 30,000 word draft of a sequel, which was tentatively titled, *Undying*. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to it's name and died on the vine. To appease the Cruel Gods of Irony, perhaps I should have named it *Unfinished*?

I was very excited about the draft, but when I went back to re-read it, I realized that it was *horrible*. Some parts of the writing were very beautiful, but the story as a whole didn't hold together *at all*. I was crushed. For about two hours. 

See, to be that excited about something and have it be that bad when you came back to it -- something was very, very wrong. Very simply, I didn't know what I was doing when it came to story. This admission was humbling, humiliating and liberating.

At this point I was already a successful writer. I had gotten a lot of praise and money for the things I've written. Granted, I had only written one novel, but people praised and bought it. Everyone wants to protect their ego, but I had *evidence* with which to do it.

But that doesn't change the reality. I just didn't understand how story worked. And I didn't have a way of working with the architecture of a large story to get a sense of whether it would work. The only way I knew how to construct a story was by writing it. And it had just kicked my ass. 

So I did what you should do. I picked myself up and started learning. I began to outline obsessively. I read every half-decent book I could get my hands on. And some that were downright crappy. I can recommend a few. Even if you are not a writer, these may help you enjoy story more. Which is a win in my book.

So, the excerpt. It's from Jack's perspective. The idea being, in the first book they called this guy into existence, now they have to deal with the consequences. 

It's a little drafty. Most of all, there is a shift between present tense and simple past tense. I started to rewrite it, but why? This happens to me a bit when I'm writing. I'm still looking for the place where this shift in tense will create a dramatic immediacy. But there is an older, wiser voice in my head that tells me I should "Quit screwing around and get on with the story.

## "Where the light flickers, the darkness leaps and laps."

<br>

IT IS NOT QUITE APPROPRIATE to call Jack a person. Oh, he was once. But the fear and the intense interest of a million or so Londoners — and his own violent acts — transformed Jack into something more. And those few fog-struck months have echoed through the years, somehow growing louder and louder as all else about the late 1880’s has faded away. So let’s call Jack what he is; a very stubborn collection of ideas.



As Jack wandered the city, he wondered where the night had gone. Jack  was not a fan of electric light. It’s too harsh. Too easy. Too absolute. Where had the night gone? These sheep think they have driven back the darkness. Banished it by the flick of a switch or a thought. The light blots out the stars and dims the moon. It denies them a sense of their scale.

Jack realized that was what he was for; restoring a sense of proportion. Even though Jack couldn't remember exactly who he was for sure, he fancied himself a gentleman. He reveled in his sense of proportion.

Of course, Jack was kidding himself. He was not  restoring a sense of proportion than a shark perfects a school of Tuna or the Wolf Pack Inc. labors to create a more genetically perfect sheep. No, Jack was a hunger unburdened of the debris of modern ideas. He had no self-doubt, only appetite.

Jack was right about the light. Gaslight, candles, lanterns or whale oil give one a sense of the night. It gives the darkness a smell and a ripping, sputtering or crackling noise. A low growl as if monsters lurked far, far off in the darkness. Most importantly, where the light flickers, the darkness leaps and laps. Hungers for the moment when the candle gutters out and Master Black reclaims his cyclic dominion over the night and the covered places.

Non-electric light never lets you forget that the darkness is there and that it is hungry for you. In the modern world, we only get the briefest reminders of this primal truth. Fumbling for the light switch in an unfamiliar room. Perhaps you hear a sound. Perhaps it’s a change in smell. The feeling that something is looking at you in a closed room with no light. The shiver. Even the texture of the wallboard seems sinister as you slide your hand in search of the switch.

Snap. Older light switches make a definitive snap and the darkness seems to vanish. Light a lamp and you’ll see in slow motion what happens when you turn on your track lighting. The darkness retreats. But not in a clean, even front. It retreats resentfully, leaving shadowy claw marks as it goes. Hanging on for as long as it can. And letting you know in its surly, watery body language, that it will be back.

He’s an idea, Jack is. And no matter how bright your lights may be. No matter how dazzled by technology you may become, ideas have consequences, and they always have. The more you believe in them, the more powerful they become. And now, nobody seems to be able to tell the good ideas from the bad ideas. “Turning and turning,” thinks Jack, “turning and turning.” He walks as he thinks, lifting his feet like a dancer, not from the ankle, but from the toes. As his weight shifts forward and his other foot touches the ground, it is the toes that touch first. Tip toeing through a crowd he is. Jack is tiptoeing through a crowd.


These thoughtlessly consuming city dwellers. People who, sitting at the greatest height of material advancement that mankind has ever known — thinking that they have banished the darkness and conquered disease — people who think food comes in boxes, who are complicit in houses of slaughter they will never see — the weak-willed tribe of comfort

But as Jack looks closer, he sees a man scratching his neck. A woman clawing at her leg beneath her tight, professional skirt. For all their arrogance, they are slipping backwards. These are the bites of bedbugs, infesting this city as surely as they did London at the turn of the century.

Beneath his feet, he can feel rats coursing through the sewers as if they were in his own veins. On all sides there is the darkness. It cannot be conquered with modern conceits or electric lights. At best it can only be held at bay through constant vigilance. And these soft people have abandoned the defenses. The sentries are gone. The walls have crumbled. The weapons have rusted. Madman that he is, Jack runs free in the streets. And once again, darkness swells in the holds of plague ships

Without thinking about, with really even looking up, he falls in behind one. In Jack’s day, they never used to dress like this. No, no, not even the whores would dress like this. Her skirt is tight. Her heels are high, and he can hear her soul thrumming as she walks. Tighter than the bun she wears her hair in. Tighter than the pencil skirt that binds at the knees. Tighter than her toes, jammed cruelly into expensive shoes.

He can feel her stress. Hear it, as she draws the precious thing of her life tight and plucks it with her petty worries.

Like a taught bowstring, thinks Jack, she is simply begging for release. And Auld Jack, release is what he specializes in.

It’s late when she gets back to her apartment building. As the night doorman holds the door open for her, Jack steps in behind her. He is no more than a breath of cold air on her shoulder. Insubstantial, nonthreatening, merely an idea. As her shoes crack an angry, impatient rhythm across the marble of the lobby, Jack is with her.

She presses the elevator call button. And waits, impatiently for what she wants. She is irritated by a strand of hair that has come undone and dangles in her face. She brushes it back and tips her throat.

Jack can resist no more. He whisks her into the stairwell in a cloud of cold, swirling dark. He takes her below ground. It’s quiet there. At least that much hasn’t changed.

<div class="centered">• • •</div>

He drags his feet on the sidewalk and sucks air in through the side of his teeth. What this city needs, he thinks, is more industry. There’s not enough particles in the air. Not as much for him to coalesce into a fog of concealment. Industry. That’s what the city lacks. It’s all stores selling pretty things for the ladies — bright shiny bits of — technology, is that what they call it. Electronics. Shimmering screens and distractions. A city of bankers and harlots who think they are proper civilized ladies. The believe they are bright gentry of a new world, when all they are simply whores bought and paid. A city of soft hands and dull knives, thinks Jack. 

Ah, to start a panic here, would be to rule to rule the world. They see reality through a blur, through a squint, in the fuzzy out-of-focus way that the world looks when you spend all your time peering into a tiny little screen — reading messages from people you don’t really know — watching stories you don’t really care about. 

He watches them — he watches everything, as he always has. In the tunnels, on the trains, not exactly slack-jawed, but mind-annihilated as the music pours in through their ears and they watch the world flow by them as if it was on a screen. As if reality was something that can’t touch them. As if they can avoid noticing mortality when it comes to call for them. 
As if, when the knife slips in between their ribs, as if they will be able to avoid the pain of it by skipping to another song. As if a Slanket or a thousand other plush, useless things order by phone while drunk watching late night tv will keep the cold of the grave off of them. As if the flames of hell could be held back by turning up the air conditioner.
Auld Jack has no illusions. That’s what it means to be free, you see. He knows he’s going to hell. He knows that this dirty, broken world is as good as it gets. That everything he does here counts and will be counted, in ways he cannot even fathom. Get your laughs now, says Auld Jack. As Mary said, so many years ago, or was it yesterday, Mary with the bright eyes and dirty hair writhing under the knife in that dirty yard? As she said, “A short time living, a long time dead.”
A whore at peace with the end. Not wanting it. Not fearing it, but in acceptance. A rare thing. No illusions
All they have in this city is illusions. 
But that’s fine with Auld Jack. That’s why he thinks he’s here, after all. He’s a reminder. A note from the universe penned in the cursive of a knife that says, “There are more things, Horatio, more things than are dreamed of in your philosophy.”
 Philosophy, mutters Jack in disgust, as he shuffles down a street on the East side. No philosophy, 

He takes another one on the corner at random. Knife in the kidney, as the signal changes. He walks on while the woman slumps onto a trash can. She doesn’t even know she’s dead yet. No one will ever connect this murder with him. And it’s unsatisfying for him — yet somehow necessary — the quick ones, to tide him over between his ceremonies. Between the red and wet things he does that gives it all meaning. 
There are so many ways to die in this city. If not for his art, he would not see the need to carry a knife. A nudge on any street corner and death lies beneath the wheels of rushing motor carriages. A push that results in a bump that creates a stumble on a subway platform the moment before the train arrives — it is all so anonymous and all too easy. To Jack these ways signify nothing — they feel like cheating. And Auld Jack is of the old school, faire and bloody play above all. 

At this thought he smiles and scares a mother and her children as they pass him on the sidewalk. The cold of his yellow teeth cuts them to the bone. 

But an artist must have a signature, a stamp, a style so that his public may know him and clamour for more of his art — or revile him and plaster his oeuvre in calumny — matters not, knows Jack. All that is required is that they know you name. And Auld Jack, has worked hard for his name. 

Yes, thinks, Jack, this city will come to fear him. These fat people, protected from the real world, weak like veal, but of sweet flesh and sweeter fear. And he will suck their fear from the marrow of their bones. He will remind them of the reality of horror. 

The fear he will bring, he imagines, will be as fire in an ancient and densely packed forests. When the inferno rages so hot that the tongues of flame no longer need to caress the next victim. The very heat will be so hot that the sap of neighboring trees will boil out through the skin and the bark will explode with the heat of the conflagration. 

That is how their fear will be. Sweet, and in chained reaction. 
Jack will grow powerful here. This herd is well-trained to respond to fear. 

He would have sworn, in the last time he had played his eternal game, that the new world would have been made of sterner stuff. But humans are so weak of will. And so his kind is allowed to feed and thrive.
