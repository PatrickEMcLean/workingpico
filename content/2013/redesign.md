# How Redesigning My Website Made Me Hate the Web

This started off as a post to announce my website redesign" but about halfway through it broke loose and turned into something worth reading. The reason why is that I've not only retooled the website, but I've also retooled the way I *work* and the way I think about *the web*. And with the web, my thoughts are pretty simple. I've come to hate it. 

## Constructively Dissatisfied

To paraphrase H.L. Mencken, "Every decent person is ashamed of the web they browse." Sure, the internet is an incredible medium, but most of the bandwidth is devoted to porn, theft and animated gifs of some teenage boy nutshotting himself on a rusty railing to the cruel laugher of camera-wielding hyenas.

Twitter can be used for amazing things. But mostly it's a running tally of what people had for lunch. Don't even get me started on Instagram and Facebook.

The web may be infinitely wide and long, but most of the time the goddamned thing feels an inch deep at best. To redesign this site, I reviewed all of the content I had produced since 2005. It was eye-opening. I could literally see myself grow shallow, stupid and weak. Where ever I got caught up in producing "content" to create a "buzz" or for "social media" the quality went to shit. And, as ashamed as I am of that fact, it feels good to come right out and say it. 

## I'm Sick of Getting Pushed Around by the Medium

PowerPoint makes it very easy to create very bad presentations. Some of these presentations kill people. Most of them add to the overflowing store of human misery. And if you want to make something beautiful with the tool of PowerPoint, you have to be strong.[^haikudeck] 

The very medium itself seems to make people shallow, petty, angry and weak. It doesn't have to be this way, but if it's going to change, more people need to stand up to this insipid bully. Here's how I'm doing it. 

## 1 -- Less Content, More Quality. 

One post a month. 

One book a year. 

That's my new baseline. 

There is an urban legend that suggests that modern Japanese swords are vastly inferior in quality to ancient Japanese swords. The story goes that the knowledge to make these amazing blades has been lost. But it's not true. There are blades every bit as good (or perhaps better) being made today. You just can't buy them. And I mean *you* specifically. 

To purchase the highest-quality blade, you have to have an introduction. You probably have to visit the sword-maker. And then, if you have enough money (and you don't commit some innocent breach of horrendously complicated Japanese etiquette) you may buy a sword. Here's why. 

In Japan, a master sword-maker is licensed to produce a certain number of swords in his lifetime. If he (and his two assistants) produce a blade that is in any way not up to snuff, they break it and start over. These are serious men. In addition to being master-bladesmiths, they are almost always Shinto priests as well. They don't care about growing market share. The quantity of blades they will produce is fixed. The only thing in question is the quality. 

In a very real way, my quantity is fixed as well. I only have so much time. And when I look at it like that, frittering that time away on clever status updates doesn't just strike me as a bad idea. It seems something of sin. 


## 2 -- Better Tools

I owe WordPress a tremendous debt. Before I started using it for the Seanachai, I was coding my rss feed by hand.[^feedvalidator] For me, this was the digital equivalent of breaking rocks -- labor that was cruel, pointless and hard.

But WordPress forces you into a certain kind of site. Begs you to use widgets and plug-ins. And the that design WordPress themes have a certain aesthetic and ethos. It's focused around images and metadata rather than words.

All the sites that I admire have beautiful design and an elegant focus on just what matters. To get to that with any WordPress theme that I could find seemed to require a lot of hacking away. On top of which, WordPress is slow and frequently hacked. 

Instead, I went with something called [Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/). It's a stupidly simple and blazing fast, flat file CMS. And for me, it's awesome.


## 3 -- A Better Workflow. 

Next month, I'm going to announce a new novel and present a comprehensive overview of how I used [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and Github for the writing process. I used Markdown because Markdown + Code Folding + A Good Text Editor = blinding speed.[^speed] And everyone knows Microsoft Word = Pain. 

I used Github because it allowed me to document and track every single step of the way. And with the entire evolution of a book in a git repository, I can create some fascinating ways to look at a book.

But because I use Markdown and am not terribly afraid of HTML/CSS, Pico is a nicer, faster way for me to work. It gives me granular control. Rather than fighting WordPress, it's now like I'm working in the elegant domain of book design. 

And not least of all. I remapped my capslock key to delete the word behind the cursor. If that seems like a small thing, then you don't realize how many times a day I hit the backspace key. 

## 4 -- A Timeline 

Not a unique design idea by any stretch. But laying my work out on a time line forces me to focus on my real goal. A consistent body of work. Rather than losing the plot while trying to scroll through the last three "12 Ways To Use One Weird Old Trick To Pick Up Chicks" posts. 

Also, because I tried to cull my output to 12 posts a year, it really forced me to revisit and re-edit my work. I learned a lot from curating my own content. It's not just that I'm a better writer than I was in 2005. It's that now I can better ask myself, "Is this really what I want to be writing? And the way I want to be writing about it."

## Compromising with the Monster.

The more time I spend on-line, the more the world seems to be a nervous, fearful, frenetic and disposable place. That's not the kind of world I want to live in, not the kind of life I want to have and not the kind of work I want to do. I'm after bedrock -- a foundation that are solid enough to build for the ages. 

But since the Internet presents the most wonderful revolution in publishing and communication since Gutenberg, my compromise is this: I will create the best work of which I am capable. I will seek the best work of others. And I will work hard to ignore the insignificant sound and fury of the inch-deep web.



[^haikudeck]: You don't believe me that the tool can warp the
user. Try [Haiku Deck](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/haiku-deck-presentation-slideshow/id536328724?mt=8) and let me know what you think.

[^feedvalidator]: I have never had the kind of love-hate relationship with anything as I had with feedvalidator.com in those early months of 2005. Love, because it saved my ass. Hated, because I always, always, always broke the feed when I updated it. 

[^speed]: I've finally settled on Sublime Text 2. But the promise of even more blinding speed has me listening to the siren song of [Vim](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/03/21/why-vim/)
