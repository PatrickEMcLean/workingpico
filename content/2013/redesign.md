# Towards a New Philosophy of Web Publishing

How I have come to hate The Web but love my new website 

I realized I didn't just hate my website I hated the Web. 

I started to call this post, "Website Redesign" but that title is far to innocuous for what I'm up to. Sure, I've retooled the website, but I've also retooled the way I *work* and the way I think about *the web*. And with the web, my thoughts are pretty simple. I've come to hate it. 

## Constructively Dissatisfied

To paraphrase H.L. Mencken, "Every decent person is ashamed of the web they browse." Sure, the internet is an incredible medium, but most of the bandwidth is devoted to porn, theft and animated gifs of some teenage boy nutshotting himself on a rusty railing to cruel laugher of camera-holding hyenas.

Twitter can be used for amazing things. But mostly it's a running tally of what people had for lunch. Don't even get me started on Instagram and Facebook.

The web may be infinitely wide and long, but most of the time the goddamned thing only feels an inch deep. As I redesigned this site, I reviewed all of the content I had produced since 2005. It was eye-opening. I could literally see myself growing shallow, stupid and weak. Where ever I got caught up in producing "content" to create a "buzz" or for "social media" the quality went to shit. And, as ashamed as I am of that fact, it feels good to come right out and say it. 

## Sick of Getting Pushed Around by the Medium

PowerPoint presentations are bad because most people aren't very good communicators. Mostly they don't put any time, thought or care in to what they want to say. But PowerPoint also makes it very easy to put together a bad presentation.[^haikudeck] 

The web is like this. The very medium itself seems to make people shallow, petty, angry and weak. It doesn't have to be this way, but if it's going to change, more people need to stand up to this insipid bully. But how?

## Better Design

Responsive, beautiful type, an elegant focus on just what matters -- these are the characteristics of the websites I admire. Take away the word responsive and you've got most of what I admire in the world. 

But Wordpress, much as I have been in love with it, makes this elegant focus very hard. Look at all the crap in the default theme. Look at all the widgets and plug-ins they temp you with. On top of which, Wordpress is slow and easily hacked. 

## Better Workflow

I now write in Markdown using one of a few world-class text editors. Plain Text/Markdown allows me to do all kinds of cool things, but the real reason I use it is that allows me to be *fast*. Especially with novels. I can open, search and otherwise power through a 100,000 word draft in milliseconds. You want to use 

## The Amazing Insights of a Timeline

## Step One -- Punt Wordpress

I've used WordPress since 2006. And it has been a great help. But Wordpress wants to make things complicated. I couldn't find a WordPress theme that stripped away all the stuff that coders and designers cared about -- metadata, image galleries, nifty designy bits -- so that I could focus on what my content really is -- carefully considered words.

Ideas, man, Ideas! That's what what I'm after. The distilled sap of experience crystallized into the amber of well-crafted words. To put it in different terms, I don't want a better effects pedal, I want a more faithful amplifier. And most people on the web are obsessed with the effects.

## Rebuilding My Aesthetic 



## The New Goal





* general dissatisfaction with the depth of content on the web
* Sick of getting pushed around by the form (take control powerpoint makes it easy to make bad design choices. So too does wordpress)
* using cool new tools. (markdown, github, beautiful type google fonts and new displays)
* curating my own content (and learning from that)
* structure as my goal. (one really great thing a month.)
* editing my own writing and charting my own development. 
* two versions of a new keyboard?
* From sickness, strength



I can feel myself getting shallow, stupid and weak. 



The formula goes like this. 

1. Something Happens
2. Two or three people generate opinions
3. A bazillion other people express the same opinions in a vain effort to be an individual.
