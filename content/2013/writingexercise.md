# Strategic Writing

I've just posted a [strategic writing exercise](http://goodwordsrightorder.com/exercise) that I do for **good words** (right order)[^1]. It's excellent -- really, one of the best things I've ever done -- and I'd recommend it to anyone who has a job or wants one someday.

It takes about an hour, and I've broken it down into four videos with tiny writing assignments after each. If you finish the whole thing, there's a form to send it to me so I can give some feedback. I promise you, if you put in the time, I'll put in the time.

[^1]: If none of this makes any sense to you, check out the [Speaking/Teaching](/speaking.md) page for some context.
