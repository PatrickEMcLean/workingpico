# The Story So Far

In the beginning, the Earth cooled. After that came the Dinosaurs. Then a comet. Then mammals ruled the Earth. And one of them, a descendant of a tribe of uppity, marrow-sucking hominids that originally hailed from what is now the Ethiopian Rift Valley, decided he was a writer. His name was Patrick.

While this choice was less destructive than the Extinction Level Event  that wiped out the Dinosaurs and charred the K-T barrier into the geologic record, it was still a pretty big deal for Patrick. It led to all kinds of irresponsible, self-destructive and often hilarious behavior which includes complications like  a Career in Advertising and the writing of six books.

Patrick's works also include:

* [How to Succeed in Evil](#evil)
* [Hostile Takeover](#hostile)
* [Consultation with a Vampire](#vampire)
* [Unkillable](#unkillable)
* [Stories I Told Myself](#stories)


If you click on any of the links above you will be rewarded with a description and more links.[^blame] These links will include free audio version of most of the  books and places you can buy physical and e-versions of Patrick's work. 

He also has an email list, of which you are now a member. Consider yourself a one of an Elite few. The membership of this list passively excludes the vast majority of humanity. The Queen of England is not on this list. No past or current President is on this list. No Rock Star, Academy Award Winner or Bilderberg Attendee is on this list. But you? You, sir (or madame) have made the cut. 

You have searched. You have sought. You have quite possibly autofilled the wrong form in a drunken stupor. But whatever the case may be, welcome to what must be the most exclusive (or obscure) fraternity/sorority of which you've ever been a member -- the email list of Author Patrick E. McLean.

Astonishment and Best Wishes, 

Patrick E. 

[^blame]: Don't blame me, this is how the internet works. Links, links, links and link baiting.
