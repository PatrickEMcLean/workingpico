What happens when a loyal henchman, or better yet, hench-laywer rebels against his criminal mastermind?

The answer is Hostile Takeover, the sequel to How to Succeed in Evil. Victorious over the forces of good (such as they are) Edwin Windsor is free to do the most evil thing he can imagine: open up an insurance company. Sure, it’s a cover for using the Cromoglodon (think, the Hulk) in a protection racket, but when Omdemnity Insurance begins to succeed on it’s own merits, it creates a problem for his loyal, violent, debaucherous and very, very short hench-lawyer Topper. When you get into the game for the action, the last thing you want is a real job.

After Edwin and his company suck all the fun out of his life, Topper rebels. Staging an unlikely, uphill coup against the smartest, most thorough genius he has ever known.

If you’ve ever had a job you hated. If you’ve ever secretly rooted for Lex Luthor. If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like if the henchman was in charge. And, especially if you’ve read How to Succeed in Evil, you’ll love, How to Succeed in Evil:Hostile Takeover.
