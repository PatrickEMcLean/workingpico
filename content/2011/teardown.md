A week ago (hey, was it two?) I spent some quality time talking to John Mierau for his “Podcast Teardown” series. It’s a great idea.

> The Teardown is a mini-series of 10 questions on the nature of podcasting, put to 10 well-known podcast authors. The questions are the same. The answers might just surprise you.

John has written and podcasted a couple of books himself so he knows how to ask a good question. It was a fun interview, but I’m really interested in the rest of the series. He’s got a great lineup and I’m interested in stealing all the ideas I can ;-) Seriously, if you have any aspirations or interests around podcast, check out some of these. I think it’s a brilliant idea.
