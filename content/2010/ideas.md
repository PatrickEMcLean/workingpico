title: Where Do Ideas Come From? 
*/


I was always told that advertising was a business of "ideas." But the strange thing was that none of the people who told me that could elaborate much more on ideation. Which is disturbing. It's like running a steel company and being a little foggy on how a furnace works. 

This talk, which I gave at the 1st Ignite Charlotte, summarizes all of the practical things I think I know about ideation.
